# Bash profile function to switch JDK versions for Mac users

This is a Bash profile function called `switchjdk` for Mac or Linux users to switch JDK versions on the command line. The `switchjdk` function changes `java`, `javac` and other JDK command for the terminal/shell, and subprocesses. It does not have an effect on things outside that particular terminal.

## Rationale

I found myself dissatisfied with both the built-in `usr/libexec/java_home` capability, as well as [jenv](https://github.com/gcuisinier/jenv) even though that is otherwise highly refined. Principally this is because they do not do the right thing for Maven's `~/.maven_rc` file at the same time as switching the JDK.

# OS X Installation

##  Install via Homebrew 

[See here](https://github.com/paul-hammant/homebrew-tap)

Quick install via Homebrew:

```bash
$ brew install paul-hammant/tap/switchjdk
$ source ~/.bash_profile
```

## Install manually

1. Copy `switchjdk-module.bash` to `/usr/local/etc/`
2. Paste the contents of `switchjdk-module.bash` into `~/.bash_profile`
3. Run `source ~/.bash_profile`

# Ubuntu Installation

Adapt as necessary for other distros

1. Copy `switchjdk-module.bash` to `/etc/profile.d/switchjdk-module.sh`
2. Restart shell or run `source /etc/profile.d/switchjdk-module.sh`

# Using switchjdk

```
$ switchjdk 7
JDK 1.7: JAVA_HOME and PATH changed for this terminal (and subprocesses).
```

1. This only works on installed JDKs.
2. You can do with JDK numbers (1.4 thru 1.11), or Java numbers (5 thru 11) - Oracle and Apple JDKs. Note 11 is presently 'early access'.
3. You can also do 1.7 thru 1.8 (7 thru 8) for the [**Zulu** varient of the OpenJDK](http://www.azul.com/downloads/zulu/).
4. The script **chooses the highest minor version of the JDK** to use (say JDK 1.5.1 over 1.5.0). At the time of writing 11 is early access only, and I don't know what the numbers will look like for the real release until closer to that moment.
5. There's a `--quiet` or `-q` argument that stops it doing the final line. Example below.
6. Regardless of whether you have Maven installed or not, switchjdk modifies the tiny `~/.maven_rc` file appropriately.
8. The switchjdk function does not know about other OpenJDK variants of the JDK (Pull Requests accepted), just the Oracle and Apple and Zulu ones.

The switchjdk command attempts to verify the outcomes, and fast fail if things are not right.  E.g. `switchjdk 5` on a new Mac will tell you that JDK 1.5 is really a symlink to JDK 6, like so:

```
$ switchjdk 5
Requested JDK is not really installed. It is symlinked to JDK 1.6
```

# JDK 12 release (March 2019)

Make sure you delete pre-release versions:

```
sudo rm -rf /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-12-33.jdk
# and others
```

## Options

## --quiet

```
$ switchjdk --quiet 7
```

## zulu

```
$ switchjdk zulu 7
Zulu 1.7: JAVA_HOME and PATH changed for this terminal (and subprocesses).
```
